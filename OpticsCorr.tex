\section{Combined corrections}

One of the difficulties encountered in the optics correction in CTF3 was 
the interplay between different properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item orbit
\item dispersion
\item emittance and Twiss parameters
\end{itemize}
Subsequent implementation of the corrections on each of the parameters was rarely converging
to a fully satisfactory values: the parameter in question was corrected but the other two
got spoiled. A possible solution, which unfortunately was never tried in CTF3,
is to perform a global correction aiming to correct all these parameters simultaneously.
